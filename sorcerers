This is my notes from the class

Go to no-ip.com and see what it is used for



SETTING UP YOUR DIGITAL OCEAN DATABASE

In order to setup your database, you have to go to digitalocean.com, create droplets
which means creating a cloud server. Choose the plan and create your root password
Root password is 01_Oluwatoni

Go to the database server you just created and go to the console in order to install jdk 17.
apt openjdk-17-jdk

Inorder to adduser in linux for your db, you do
adduser name
once you add the name you can clone your repo in order to merge with the db by doing
you have to cd into it which will give you a path like /home/name
git clone url
Once you clone it you have to cd into the project, then run this command to generate your build
./gradlew build -x test
Once the build is generated you can finally get the JAR file which is like a zip file for all your Java code in this path
 build/libs. You will get a red JAR name that you can use to run the whole build which is
 java -jar JAR_NAME
